BTW. Some quotes:

"When you switch to a different IDE one of the things you miss most is your old favourite keyboard shortcuts."
(Dino Esposito, 19.Aug.2013, https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Configure+Keymap )

"Switching from Eclipse to IntelliJ IDEA was a great decision. Eclipse of course gets things done, but not as fast, not as flawless, not as intelligent as IntelliJ.
And yet, the switching process took me some time. Especially learning new shortcuts was a little bit irritating. Performing basic tasks took me minutes, because I had to look up the correct shortcut each time. It’s possible to use an Eclipse shortcut mapping, but since I wasn’t going to switch back, I’ve decided to learn the default mapping."

"IntelliJ is supposed to have that Eclipse keymaps since the Demetra 6.0.5 version...
To get Eclipse Shortcuts, go to "Settings" and type "keymap". Then select Eclipse on the list."
